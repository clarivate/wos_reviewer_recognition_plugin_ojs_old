### Usage
For the plugin to work, the journal should be an official partner of Web of Science Reviewer Recognition Service. Please see information about purchasing this service [here](https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-publishing-solutions/reviewer-recognition-service/), or <a href="mailto:reviewservices@clarivate.com">email us</a> to start giving your reviewers recognition.


When the plugin is enabled, a button "Export my review to Web of Science" will be present on "Completed" tab after the reviewer has submitted their review. After the reviewer has clicked on this button and confirmed they want to send their review to Web of Science, the review data is sent automatically and reviewer receives an invitation to claim it (or it is automatically added if reviewer has Web of Science Researcher Profile and opted in to automatically add reviews from partnered journals).
The Web of Science website certifies only the fact the reviewer has completed peer review for the current journal. The text of the review can be disclosed on Web of Science only after publication of the article and if both the publication author and journal allow it. To disclose the text of the review, the reviewer should input the DOI of the published article on Web of Science.
